# VCORE Collective Blog on Medium

## Why

Why blog (Medium Publication) is the best way to share outcomes of our work:

* VCORE code is too specific to Daimler and has direct connection to Pilot, sharing source may not be easy/good idea
* The main value is not a code but learning of creating distributes system. Many problems we addressed are not well covered by media. We will help others by summarizing and sharing it.
* Being the Editor and Writer of topical blog is good plus in CV
* Writing a blog is a good way to summarize our experience and be prepared for interviews
